Var :is a keyword used to declare a variable.
     It cannot replace a specific data type in a function.
     Inside a function, if you define a variable using var,
     the compiler assigns the data type based on the initial value of that variable.
Dynamic:is data type can be equal any data type knowing 
          and can declear it in function.
explicitly typed variables: is data type like (int , double ,String) it make program 
     more easier ,clear and helped avoid mistakes
